# Bayesian-Persuasion
This is a project about Bayesian persuasion, where you can solve an information designer problem with single player, binary actions and binary states very conveniently. We first include the code needed for a one stage Bayesian persuasion problem, but then we will add codes for sequential problem. We will finally try to extend all these to a general information design problem with multiple periods, multiple players, multiple actions and multiple stages.
